#data_collector â€“ Event-Driven Email Alerts with AWS Lambda

Uses AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events, to automate data collection and real-time email notifications. This #data_collector system enables efficient monitoring and alerting without managing infrastructure.

Key components:

Event-Driven Architecture: Triggers Lambda functions using sources like Amazon S3 uploads, API Gateway calls, CloudWatch Events, or custom integrations.

Lambda Processing: The Lambda function processes incoming data, applies filtering or transformation logic, and evaluates alerting conditions.

Email Delivery: When criteria are met, the Lambda function sends emails via Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) or another email service to notify users or systems.

Scalability & Cost Efficiency: Leveraging Lambda's automatic scaling and pay-per-use model ensures low operational overhead.

Ideal for lightweight data pipelines, monitoring systems, and notification workflows.
